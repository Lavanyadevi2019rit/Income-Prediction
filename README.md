# Income-Prediction
Income Prediction is used to identify respective trends and behaviors, such that we can predict a persons income with the given input data.

# Project Summary
Income Prediction is a combination of data collection, pattern analysis, predictive modeling and analysis of prediction as well. To analyse what are the best combination of age, education, marital-status, etc. for person’s Income and for some business purpose Income prediction is so much important. Now we understood the importance of the Person’s Income prediction then here are few steps through which we can achieve the result.

# Azure Services
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model in which the dataset will be selected or imported. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, select the required blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks.

# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
Create Project/Experiment and import the data set from local file system. After creating experiment, we need to drag and drop the required modules.

The following are the modules I have used in my project:

Data set:

Data set required for experiment is added as CSV file.

Editing Metadata:

It is used to change data type of fields, etc.

Splitting data:

Split the data for training and evaluation.

Score labels:

Score labels provide the output . We can visualize the datasets.

Evaluate model:

Evaluate model will give the accurate values. The model gives an accuracy of 96.9% and precision of 93.6%. After creating these models, run the model by clicking run button which is in the bottom side. After running successfully, we can score and evaluate the model.

# DEPLOYING THE MODEL
Deploy the model by Setting up Web Service in Machine Learning Studio. If it is first time, select Update Predictive Experiment. After deployment of model, it can be used in webs.

Consumption options:

Excel 2010 or earlier Request-Response Web App Template
